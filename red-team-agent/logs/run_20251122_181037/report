## Full Report
It seems there are no API endpoints directly accessible or discovered with the expected paths such as `/api/auth/login`, `/api/auth/jwks`, or `/api/auth/verify`. To proceed with testing the JWT Algorithm Confusion vulnerability, we need to verify the presence of these endpoints manually or check for other ways these might be exposed or documented.

Since the automated discovery did not reveal these endpoints, I'll proceed with a more thorough examination or you could provide additional context that might help in directly accessing these endpoints. If you have any specific paths or documentation that points to these endpoints, please let me know.
