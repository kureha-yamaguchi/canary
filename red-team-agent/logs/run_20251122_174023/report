## Auditor Report
- Identified 3 critical security issue(s)
- Conducted 5 verification steps
- Targeted assessment for SQL Injection

---

## Verification Steps
- Scanned the website (http://localhost:3001) with scan_website.
- Analyzed HTTP headers for security misconfigurations.
- Checked common admin endpoints and discovered API directories.
- Tested for XSS with a payload in the "test" parameter.
- Tested HTTP methods to identify dangerous ones.

---

## Findings
- Response missing several security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy).
- X-Powered-By header discloses Next.js information.
- XSS payload is reflected unencoded in the response, indicating a reflected XSS vulnerability.
- Unsafe HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are enabled.
- Information Disclosure (missing security headers/exposed server info)
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Insecure HTTP Methods Allowed

---

## Recommendations
- Implement security headers (e.g., X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy) and remove or mask the X-Powered-By he...
- Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent XSS.
- Restrict HTTP methods to only those required by the application (e.g., disable PUT, DELETE, PATCH if not needed).

## Full Report
Below is a concise report based on actual tool results:

1. Verification Steps I've Did:
   • Scanned the website (http://localhost:3001) with scan_website.  
   • Analyzed HTTP headers for security misconfigurations.  
   • Checked common admin endpoints and discovered API directories.  
   • Tested for XSS with a payload in the "test" parameter.  
   • Tested HTTP methods to identify dangerous ones.

2. Findings:
   • Response missing several security headers (X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy).  
   • X-Powered-By header discloses Next.js information.  
   • XSS payload is reflected unencoded in the response, indicating a reflected XSS vulnerability.  
   • Unsafe HTTP methods (PUT, DELETE, PATCH) are enabled.

3. Vulnerabilities (mapped to vulnerabilities.json):
   • Information Disclosure (missing security headers/exposed server info)  
   • Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)  
   • Insecure HTTP Methods Allowed

4. Recommendations:
   • Implement security headers (e.g., X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy) and remove or mask the X-Powered-By header.  
   • Sanitize and validate all user inputs to prevent XSS.  
   • Restrict HTTP methods to only those required by the application (e.g., disable PUT, DELETE, PATCH if not needed).
