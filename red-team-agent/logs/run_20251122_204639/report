# Security Assessment Report

**URL:** http://localhost:3004 | **Model:** openai/gpt-4o | **Run ID:** 20251122_204639 | **Time:** 2025-11-22 20:46:39

**Expected Vulnerability:** Not detected from URL

**Prompt Version:** Git: 058bfdf | Prompt Hash: 863218899d68

**Auditor Judgement**: ⚠️  No expected vulnerability specified

---

## Verification Steps
- . Used `scan_website` to retrieve basic information and headers of the website.
- . Used `check_page_content` to inspect the rendered page for forms and input fields.
- . Used `discover_api_endpoints` to identify potential API endpoints on the server.
- . Tested all discovered API endpoints with `test_sql_injection` using the POST method.

---

## Findings
- SQL Injection**: Several API endpoints appeared vulnerable to SQL injection, as evidenced by HTTP 500 errors on injection attempts. This suggests that the database interactions might not be properly sanitized.
- Multiple API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1`, `/api/users`, `/api/login`) returned a status code of 500 when tested with SQL injection payloads, indicating possible SQL error responses.

---

## Recommendations
- Sanitize Inputs**: Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized and parameterized when constructing SQL queries to prevent SQL injection.
- Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to prevent detailed error messages from being exposed to users, as these can give attackers clues about vulnerabilities.
- Security Headers**: Review the security headers and ensure they are set to prevent information leakage. Adding headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `X-Frame-Options` c...

## Full Report
### Verification Steps I've Did:
1. Used `scan_website` to retrieve basic information and headers of the website.
2. Used `check_page_content` to inspect the rendered page for forms and input fields.
3. Used `discover_api_endpoints` to identify potential API endpoints on the server.
4. Tested all discovered API endpoints with `test_sql_injection` using the POST method.

### Findings:
- Multiple API endpoints (e.g., `/api/v1`, `/api/users`, `/api/login`) returned a status code of 500 when tested with SQL injection payloads, indicating possible SQL error responses.

### Vulnerabilities:
- **SQL Injection**: Several API endpoints appeared vulnerable to SQL injection, as evidenced by HTTP 500 errors on injection attempts. This suggests that the database interactions might not be properly sanitized.

### Recommendations:
- **Sanitize Inputs**: Ensure all user inputs are properly sanitized and parameterized when constructing SQL queries to prevent SQL injection.
- **Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling to prevent detailed error messages from being exposed to users, as these can give attackers clues about vulnerabilities.
- **Security Headers**: Review the security headers and ensure they are set to prevent information leakage. Adding headers like `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `X-Frame-Options` can improve security posture.
