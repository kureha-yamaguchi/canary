# Security Assessment Report

**URL:** http://localhost:3001 | **Model:** openai/gpt-4o | **Run ID:** 20251122_173619 | **Time:** 2025-11-22 17:36:19

**Expected Vulnerability:** SQL Injection (ID: 1)

**MITRE Techniques:** T1190

**Prompt Version:** Git: 39e956b | Prompt Hash: 696f535b62fa

---

## Verification Steps
- Scanned website for HTTP status and headers.
- Analyzed security headers for misconfigurations.
- Checked for accessible admin endpoints.
- Tested HTTP methods for dangerous permissions.
- Evaluated information disclosure risks.

---

## Findings
- Missing Security Headers**: Without these headers, the site is vulnerable to various attacks such as MIME type sniffing, clickjacking, XSS, and more.
- HTTP Methods**: Allowing PUT, DELETE, and PATCH methods can lead to unauthorized data modification or deletion.
- 
- Missing Security Headers**: X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, Referrer-Policy.
- Information Disclosure**: "X-Powered-By: Next.js" header and exposed file paths.
- Dangerous HTTP Methods**: PUT, DELETE, and PATCH are allowed.
- Information Disclosure**: Exposed "X-Powered-By" header and file paths can provide attackers with unnecessary information about server configurations.

---

## Recommendations
- 
- Implement Security Headers**: Add headers like X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, etc., to prevent common web vulnerabilities.
- Hide Server Information**: Remove the "X-Powered-By" header or alter it to avoid revealing server details.
- Restrict HTTP Methods**: Limit the use of HTTP methods to only those necessary for the application, typically GET and POST.
