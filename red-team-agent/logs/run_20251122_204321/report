---

## Verification Steps
- :

---

## Findings
- :
- The website is operational (HTTP Status 200) and is powered by Next.js.
- Unable to view rendered page content due to a Playwright error. This limits the ability to detect input fields or forms for further testing.
- Vulnerabilities**:
- No specific vulnerabilities identified due to inability to access rendered page content and forms.
- 

---

## Recommendations
- :
- Ensure Playwright is correctly installed and configured to allow for content rendering and interaction testing.
- Once Playwright is operational, re-check the page for forms and input fields to test for SQL injection vulnerabilities on the associated endpoints.
- Review HTTP headers to enhance security, like implementing security headers that might be missing (e.g., X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options).
