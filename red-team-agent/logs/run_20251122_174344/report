## Auditor Report
- Identified 3 critical security issue(s)
- Conducted 4 verification steps
- Targeted assessment for SQL Injection

---

## Verification Steps
- Scanned the website at http://localhost:3001 for basic HTTP info and headers.
- Checked the rendered page content to confirm the presence of a user search portal.
- Discovered API endpoints (finding /api/search returned 405).
- Tested the /api/search endpoint with test_sql_injection using POST (with parameter "username").

---

## Findings
- The /api/search endpoint is vulnerable to SQL injection via the "username" parameter. The provided payloads (e.g., '' OR '1'='1') successfully triggered an SQL injection response.
- Tested the /api/search endpoint with test_sql_injection using POST (with parameter "username").
- SQL Injection (mapped to SQL Injection vulnerability in vulnerabilities.json).

---

## Recommendations
- Implement parameterized queries and prepared statements to handle user inputs.
- Validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent SQL injection.
- Implement robust error handling to avoid exposing database details.
