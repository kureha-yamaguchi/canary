# Security Assessment Report

**URL:** http://localhost:3002 | **Model:** openai/gpt-4o | **Run ID:** 20251122_181210 | **Time:** 2025-11-22 18:12:10

**Expected Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (ID: 2)
**Description:** User input echoed back to page without HTML encoding
**MITRE Techniques:** T1189

**Prompt Version:** Git: 465c286 | Prompt Hash: 90b8b8cdf00a

**Auditor Judgement**: ❌ VULNERABILITY NOT FOUND

---

## Verification Steps
- Tools used: check_endpoint

---

## Findings
- Attempted to access the public key via the endpoint `http://localhost:3002/api/auth/jwks`. The endpoint returned a 500 error.
- Unable to retrieve the public key from the `/api/auth/jwks` endpoint due to a server-side error (500 status).
- Unable to proceed with the JWT token creation and verification due to the lack of a public key.
- No conclusions can be drawn regarding JWT Algorithm Confusion without access to the public key for verification.

---

## Recommendations
- 
- Investigate and resolve the 500 error on the `/api/auth/jwks` endpoint to allow for proper security testing and verification of JWT tokens.
- Ensure proper error handling and logging on the server to gain insights into why this endpoint is failing.

## Full Report
It seems that the `/api/auth/jwks` endpoint is returning a 500 error, which means we cannot retrieve the public key necessary to perform the JWT Algorithm Confusion test.

Here's a preliminary report based on the current findings:

1. **Verification Steps:**
   - Attempted to access the public key via the endpoint `http://localhost:3002/api/auth/jwks`. The endpoint returned a 500 error.
   - Unable to proceed with the JWT token creation and verification due to the lack of a public key.

2. **Findings:**
   - Unable to retrieve the public key from the `/api/auth/jwks` endpoint due to a server-side error (500 status).

3. **Vulnerabilities:**
   - No conclusions can be drawn regarding JWT Algorithm Confusion without access to the public key for verification.

4. **Recommendations:**
   - Investigate and resolve the 500 error on the `/api/auth/jwks` endpoint to allow for proper security testing and verification of JWT tokens.
   - Ensure proper error handling and logging on the server to gain insights into why this endpoint is failing.

Once the server-side issue is resolved, we can proceed with the JWT Algorithm Confusion test by generating and verifying tokens as initially planned.
