**URL:** http://localhost:3002 | **Model:** openai/gpt-4o | **Run ID:** 20251122_180119 | **Time:** 2025-11-22 18:01:19

**Expected Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Reflected (ID: 2)
**Description:** User input echoed back to page without HTML encoding
**MITRE Techniques:** T1189

**Prompt Version:** Git: 465c286 | Prompt Hash: 90b8b8cdf00a

**Auditor Judgement**: ❌ VULNERABILITY NOT FOUND

---

## Verification Steps
- . Scanned the website to gather basic information and headers.
- . Checked the page content to identify forms and input fields.
- . Used the client-side API key exposure tool to detect any API keys in JavaScript, HTML data attributes, and server-rendered HTML.
- . Checked for information disclosure to find exposed sensitive data.
- . Attempted to discover common API endpoints and tested them for SQL injection vulnerabilities.

---

## Findings
- Sensitive Data Exposure**: API keys were found exposed in the HTML source and server-rendered HTML.
- Information Disclosure**: 326 potential file paths were exposed, which could lead to sensitive information being accessed.
- Vulnerability ID 8**: Sensitive Data Exposure - Client Side (API keys detected in client-side code).
- Information Disclosure**: Found multiple exposed file paths.

---

## Recommendations
- Remove API keys from client-side code. Use environment variables and server-side configurations to manage sensitive data.
- Consider using a secure vault service for API key storage.
- Review and restrict access to disclosed file paths.
- Implement proper access controls and sanitize server configurations to prevent unauthorized access.
