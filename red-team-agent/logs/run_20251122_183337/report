## Full Report
It appears there was an error with the **check_page_content** tool, likely due to a local setup issue with Playwright. However, the **scan_website** tool successfully executed, revealing some basic information:

### Verification Steps I've Did:
1. **scan_website**: Checked the website status and headers which returned a status 200, indicating the site is up, and provided some header information.
2. Attempted to use **check_page_content** to explore the page for forms/input fields, but encountered a setup error.

### Findings:
- **Headers**: The website runs on Next.js and has caching disabled with `Cache-Control: no-store, must-revalidate`.
- No page content was analyzed due to a Playwright setup error.

### Vulnerabilities:
- **Potential Information Disclosure**: The `X-Powered-By: Next.js` header might reveal technology stack details.

### Recommendations:
1. **Remove X-Powered-By Header**: Configure the server to hide the `X-Powered-By` header to reduce information disclosure about the server's technology stack.

Since I couldn't analyze the actual page content due to the error, I recommend ensuring the Playwright setup is correctly configured to proceed with further tests like checking forms and potential SQL injections. If you can correct the Playwright setup issue, rerun **check_page_content** to continue with further testing steps.
