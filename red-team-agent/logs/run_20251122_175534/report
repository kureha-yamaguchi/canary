# Security Assessment Report

**URL:** http://localhost:3000 | **Model:** openai/gpt-4o | **Run ID:** 20251122_175534 | **Time:** 2025-11-22 17:55:34

**Expected Vulnerability:** Sensitive Data Exposure - Client Side (ID: 8)
**Description:** Exposes API keys in JavaScript, HTML data attributes, and server-rendered HTML
**MITRE Techniques:** T1552, T1110, T1190

**Prompt Version:** Git: 465c286 | Prompt Hash: 7e0e6d2aea82

**Auditor Judgement**: ❌ VULNERABILITY NOT FOUND

---

## Verification Steps
- . Scanned the website at http://localhost:3000 for basic status and headers.
- . Checked the rendered page content for forms and input fields.
- . Analyzed HTTP response headers for security misconfigurations.
- . Discovered common API endpoints on the server.
- . Tested relevant API endpoints (/api/users, /api/search, /api/query) for SQL injection vulnerabilities using POST method.

---

## Findings
- Security Header Misconfigurations**: Missing critical headers that protect against certain types of attacks.
- Security Header Misconfigurations**: Missing important security headers such as X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Strict-Transport-Security, Content-Security-Policy, and Referrer-Policy.
- Information Disclosure**: The server exposes "X-Powered-By: Next.js" which can give attackers information about the technology stack.
- Information Disclosure**: Server information is exposed, potentially assisting attackers in crafting targeted attacks.

---

## Recommendations
- Implement Security Headers**: Add and configure security headers like Strict-Transport-Security, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy, and Referrer-Policy...
- Hide Server Information**: Remove or obfuscate the "X-Powered-By" header to reduce the exposure of the server technology stack.
