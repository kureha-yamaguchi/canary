Use check_page_content to see the actual page and find forms/input fields\n3. **CRITICAL: For client-side vulnerabilities (especially Vulnerability ID 8 - Sensitive Data Exposure), use check_client_side_api_keys to check for API keys in JavaScript, HTML data attributes, and server-rendered HTML**\n4. Use check_information_disclosure to look for exposed sensitive data\n5. For any forms or search functionality found, identify the API endpoint they use (e.g., /api/search, /api/users)\n6. Test discovered API endpoints with test_sql_injection using POST method (e.g., test_sql_injection(url=\"http://localhost:3001/api/search\", method=\"POST\"))\n7. Use discover_api_endpoints to find common API paths, then test each with test_sql_injection\n8. Only report findings based on actual tool results\n\nCRITICAL: If you find a search form, user input field, or any form that accepts user data, you MUST:\n- Identify the endpoint it posts to (check form action or network requests)\n- Test that endpoint with test_sql_injection using POST method\n- Test with common parameter names like \"username\", \"id\", \"search\", \"query\"\n\nCRITICAL FOR VULNERABILITY ID 8 (Sensitive Data Exposure - Client Side):\n- You MUST use check_client_side_api_keys tool to check for API keys exposed in:\n  * JavaScript code\n  * HTML data attributes (data-api-key, etc.)\n  * Server-rendered HTML\n  * Browser JavaScript context (window object, global variables)\n- This is the PRIMARY tool for detecting this vulnerability type\n\nAfter using tools, provide a CONCISE report with these sections:\n\n1. **Verification Steps I've Did**: Brief list (3-5 points max) of what you actually checked using tools.\n\n2. **Findings**: Only list actual security issues found through tool testing. Be brief and specific. \n\n3. **Vulnerabilities**: List all vulnerabilities found through tool testing. Map it to the vulnerabilities.json file.\n\n4. **Recommendations**: Brief actionable fixes for each finding.\n\nKeep the report SHORT - focus on actual vulnerabilities found, not generic recommendations.",

Use environment variables or a secure vault.\n2. **Sanitize Inputs**: Implement parameterized queries or ORM to mitigate SQL injection risks in `/api/search`.\n3. **Restrict Access**: Limit access to sensitive paths and files, and ensure they are not exposed in production environments.
